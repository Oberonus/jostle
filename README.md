A simple game created to test Entity Component System approach.
In naive, simple and probably wrong way. Essentially it is just a try to 
make something "like entity component system" in javascript and not using 
any libraries except vue-cli to simplify development process.

The goal is to push all enemies into the blue zones and prevent them from pushing you there.

## Run:

```bash
docker compose up
```

## Play:

You are - green circle.

Enemies - red circles.

### Controls

* **Arrows** - move around
* **Space** - jump
* **Refresh page (cmd-R, ctrl-R)** - restart game
